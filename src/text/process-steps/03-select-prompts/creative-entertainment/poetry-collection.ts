    ### Poem 1: "Data Points" (Free Verse)
    Numbers dance across the screen,
    each digit a whisper of truth
    we're not ready to hear.

    Behind every percentage
    lives a story—
    forty-three percent growth
    means Sarah worked until 3 AM,
    coffee rings like halos
    of dedication.

    We measure everything
    but miss the moments
    between numbers
    where life happens.

    ### Poem 2: "The Pivot" (Sonnet)
    When markets shift like tectonic plates below,
    And strategies once firm collapse,
    The wisest leaders learn to bend and flow,
    To bridge the ever-widening gaps.

    In transformation's crucible we find
    That adaptation serves the prepared mind.

    ### Poem 3: "Algorithm Dreams" (Haiku Series)
    Patterns emerge bright—
    Hidden in vast data streams,
    Future takes its shape.

    Code runs through the night,
    Processing human choices—
    Tomorrow's blueprint.
