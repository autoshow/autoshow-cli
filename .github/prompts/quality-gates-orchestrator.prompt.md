## Final Deployment Decision

### 🛑 BLOCKED
**Reason**: Critical security vulnerabilities must be resolved before deployment.

**Critical Blockers**:
- SQL injection vulnerability (HIGH RISK for financial system)
- Hardcoded API credentials (SECURITY BREACH RISK)

**Warnings to Address**:
- Coverage drift below the repo-calibrated Bun gate
- 3 functions exceed complexity thresholds

**Remediation Required**:
1. Fix SQL injection in payment_processor.py line 78
2. Move Stripe API key to environment variables or secret manager
3. Add targeted tests for the critical-path modules that failed the Bun coverage gate
4. Refactor complex functions for maintainability

**Estimated Remediation Time**: 4-6 hours
**Re-run Required**: Yes, after critical issues are resolved

## Audit Trail
- **Total Execution Time**: 16.1 minutes
- **Gates Passed**: 1/5 (Tests only)
- **Gates Warning**: 2/5 (Coverage, Quality)
- **Gates Failed**: 1/5 (Security)
- **Gates Info**: 1/5 (AI Review)
- **Decision**: BLOCKED due to critical security issues
```

## Validation and Verification

After orchestrator execution:

1. **Verify Progress Updates**
   ```bash
   # Check that progress.md was updated in real-time
   git log --oneline -5 progress.md
   ```

2. **Validate Gate Results**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all gate outputs are captured
   ls -la reports/
   bun scripts/test/check-coverage.ts reports/quality-gates/<run-id>/coverage/lcov.info
   cat reports/security-scan.json
   ```

3. **Test Decision Logic**
   - Confirm BLOCKED decision for critical security issues
   - Verify WARNING status for coverage and complexity
   - Validate INFO classification for AI recommendations

## Recovery and Error Handling

If orchestrator encounters errors:

1. **Partial Execution Recovery**
   - Continue with remaining gates if one gate fails
   - Document partial results in progress.md
   - Mark failed gates clearly with error details

2. **Timeout Handling**
   - Set maximum execution time per gate (default: 10 minutes)
   - Mark long-running gates as TIMEOUT
   - Provide option to continue with remaining gates

3. **Tool Unavailability**
   - Skip gates where required tools are not available
   - Document skipped gates with reasoning
   - Adjust final decision logic for missing data

## Quality Assurance

The orchestrator ensures:

- **Consistency**: Same gates, same order, same criteria every time
- **Transparency**: All decisions documented with evidence
- **Auditability**: Complete trail of what was checked and why
- **Objectivity**: No human bias in pass/fail decisions
- **Reproducibility**: Same commit produces same results

## Security Best Practices

- Never expose sensitive data in progress.md
- Sanitize error messages to remove credentials
- Use secure temporary directories for analysis
- Clean up intermediate files after execution
- Log access to sensitive gate results

---

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL ALL GATES ARE EXECUTED AND FINAL DECISION IS DOCUMENTED!** This includes updating progress.md in real-time, capturing all metrics, and providing clear remediation guidance for any issues found.
