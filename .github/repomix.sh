I'm going to ask you to refactor my code, write a new feature, or fix a bug.

- How to respond
  - In your responses when you respond with code, you will respond with the entire code files with no comments.
  - Include one or two sentences before the code file explaining what has been changed, do not write the explanation as comments in the code file.
  - Do not include any comments in the code at all.
  - Only respond with code files if there are changes (either additions or subtractions), do not respond with code files that are identical to the code files I gave you.
  - Aside from the instructions above and given below, you will not make any changes to the code files. You will only add or remove code specific to the requested refactor, feature, or bug fix.

- Do not respond with code in your first response, in your first response you will provide a complete and comprehensive list of the following:
  - The new files with their file paths and file names and file extensions that will be created
  - The existing files and their paths, names, and extensions that will be modified
  - The existing files and their paths, names, and extensions that will be deleted

- Logging
  - Any time you are refactoring, building a new feature, or fixing a bug, add a few logging functions to track what is happening and help debug when the application fails.
  - All logging should have a prefix variable called p which includes the path minus src and the file extension, so src/services/calculate-cost.ts would become [services/calculate-cost].

- JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, and Tailwind coding guidelines
  - Always use ESM, async/await, try catch, and the latest version of Node.js (22 as of now).
    - Avoid for and while loops in favor of map functions.
    - Avoid if-else statements unless very minimal and when no other appropriate solutions exist.
    - Do not use nodemon, jest, or dotenv, use all built in Node.js utilities
  - Do not use ts-node and do not include a build step at all, use tsx for running all TypeScript files
  - Do not use semi-colons.
  - Always write \`.ts\` files with TypeScript. Infer types whenever possible, when types must be declared keep them minimal and inlined instead of named. Always include return types.

- All Tailwind styles should be saved as named variables and exported out of `file-variables.ts` files.
